<h1>realme 50A Prime</h1>
<h2>Expert comment: </h2>
<p>The Narzo 50A Prime places itself in a highly concentrated segment with a few phones in contention from Realmeâ€™s own stable. On the outside, the device has a premium look to it with its boxy design and glossy polycarbonate finish. Its LCD panel does not refresh higher than 60Hz but does offer FHD+ resolution. While its viewing experience remains ordinary, the device redeems itself with excellent battery life and a capable primary camera. The Narzo 50A Prime joins the list of devices that have partnered with Unisoc for processing requirements. The phone does not have a charger inside the box.
