<h1>Infinix Note 11</h1>
<h2>Expert comment: </h2>
<p> The Infinix Note 11 is the only phone on this list to come with an AMOLED panel which adds to the visual experience. While packing in a 50MP primary shooter along with a 2MP depth camera, the Note 11 also has a 16MP selfie shooter on the front. It has a capable processor that should easily tackle moderate to easy tasks. The sizeable 5,000mAh cell can easily last for more than a day and if not, the 33W fast charging juices up the phone in less than 90 minutes.</p>
