<h1>Moto G30</h1>
<h2>Expert comment: </h2>
<p>Moto G30, with its impressive cameras, high refresh rate display, and fast-charging support, is an option worth considering in this price range but you do need to keep in mind that the phone comes with only an HD+ display, not FHD+ like some other phones in this bracket. The phone's processor will be able to tackle most apps with ease but again, there are more powerful phones that you can get in this price range. One of the reasons you can probably choose Moto G30 over these phones would be its clean UI.</p>
