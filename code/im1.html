<h1>POCO M3</h1>
<h2>Expert comment: </h2>
<p> One of the main reasons to consider POCO M3 will be its massive 6,000mAh battery capacity but it is by no means the only reason this phone makes the list. The handset packs a reliable processor that will tackle any task you throw at it with ease and even allows for convenient multitasking. Combine this with great cameras, aesthetically pleasing design that might even remind of Nokia Lumia series, and fast charging support. Overall, POCO M3 offers a package that makes a lot of sense for most people.</p>
